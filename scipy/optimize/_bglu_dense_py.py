    This decorator records the time spent in the major BGLU
    routines - refactor, update, and solve - in order to
    calculate the average time required to solve a system.
    It also forces PLU factorization of the basis matrix from
    scratch to minimize the average solve time and to
    accumulation of roundoff error.

    Immediately after PLU factorization, the average solve time
    will be rather high because PLU factorization is slow. For
    some number of factor updates, the average solve time is
    expected to decrease because the updates and solves are fast.
    However, updates increase the compexity of the factorization,
    so solve times are expected to increase with each update.
    When the average solve time stops decreasing and begins
    increasing, we perform PLU factorization from scratch rather
    than updating. PLU factorization is also performed after the
    maximum permitted number of updates is reached to prevent
    further accumulation of roundoff error.
